## Algs Visualizer

A web app used for educational purposes to currently display the efficiency of different path finding algorithms with future plans to make this a one-stop-shop to learn all forms of algorithms.

## A Note On Contributions:

Contributions are closed right now due to this being a personal project. However during production I might be inclined to add more users to the project

## Built With:

Frontend Tech

- ReactJS
- TypescriptJS
- TailwindCSS
- Mapbox API

Backend tech

- NextJS (app Directory)
- Open Street Maps

Infra

- Vercel

## Current and Future Additions (Stage 1 - Scaffolding):

- [x] Mapbox integration
- [x] URL state management
- [x] Breadth First Search added
- [x] Depth First Search added
- [ ] A*
- [ ] Djikstra's
- [ ] OSM Data parser (currently broken)
- [ ] Ability for users to select an origin and destination

## Future Additions (Stage 2 - Explaners)
- [ ] Info page for each algorithm
    - [ ] Quick explanation
    - [ ] Add visualizations (stacked 3D visuals would be cool)
    - [ ] Small graphic for time and space complexity
    - [ ] Video for each algorithm (Manim/Motion Canvas)
- [ ] Quick info page for all algorithms (only show space and time complexity)

## Future Additions (Stage 3 - Expansion)
- [ ] Include more pathfinding algs
- [ ] Look into other forms of algs (evolutionary algs)

## Future Additions (Stage 4 - Real World)
- [ ] Add links to most popular papers with the algorithms
    - [ ] Paper using the algorithm
    - [ ] Paper explaining/expanding the algorithm
- [ ] Add real world data to these algorithms as a playground 

## Changes and optimizations needed
- [ ] Fix typings in visualizer page
- [ ] Change colors for DeckGL layers

## Bugs to fix
- [ ] OSM Data Parser
